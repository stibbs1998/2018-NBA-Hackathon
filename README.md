# *Super Value in a Super Team*

On September 22, 2019, I participated in the [NBA Hackathon](https://hackathon.nba.com/2018-hackathon-recap/) held in Secaucus, NJ at the NBA's Headquarters.  I was placed on a team of three other individuals from across the country - the only group to make the finals that had **not** originally applied together!  Placed on the *Business Analytics* track, we were given a month to work on a research project of our choosing that could be useful to the NBA.  Coming off the fourth straight Warriors v. Cavs NBA Finals, and being the salty Celtics/Jazz/Rockets fans that we were, we decided to investigate the financial impact a **Super Team** - such as the Warriors, Cavs, or early 2010s Heat teams - has on the NBA.  

We presented our work to a panel of NBA Executives, including Mark Tatum, Deputy Commissioner and COO of the NBA.
